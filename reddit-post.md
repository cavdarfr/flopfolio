# [Show Reddit] Flopfolio - A platform to celebrate your failures and learnings as an entrepreneur

Hey Reddit! ðŸ‘‹

I've been working on a project called **Flopfolio** - a platform that empowers entrepreneurs to showcase their entire journey, including both successes AND failures.

## Why I built this

In the startup world, we're constantly bombarded with success stories, but rarely do we see the struggles, pivots, and failures that led to those successes. As an entrepreneur myself, I've learned more from my failures than my successes, and I wanted to create a space where we can:

- Document our complete entrepreneurial journey
- Highlight valuable lessons from each experience (especially the failures)
- Help others avoid common pitfalls through our experiences
- Track our personal growth as entrepreneurs

## What it does

Flopfolio lets you:
- Create a profile showcasing your entrepreneurial journey
- Document ventures at any stage - active, completed, or discontinued
- Share specific lessons learned from each experience
- Get a personalized shareable link for your portfolio

## Tech Stack

Built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Clerk for auth, and UploadThing for file storage.

## Looking for feedback

This is an MVP version, and I'd love to hear your thoughts:

1. Is this something you'd use as an entrepreneur?
2. What features would make this more valuable to you?
3. Would you be willing to share your failures publicly if it helps others?
4. Any suggestions on how to build a community around this concept?

You can check out the project at [GitHub repo link] or the live demo at [demo link if available].

Thanks for taking the time to check this out! All feedback (positive or constructive) is greatly appreciated.
